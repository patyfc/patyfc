###
I have a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Information Systems back in Brazil. I moved to Calgary to study the two-year New Media Production and Design program at Southern Alberta Institute of Technology.
Currently, I am diligently studying and acquiring skills in cloud computing to make a career transition into this dynamic field. With a strong foundation in technology and a keen interest in cutting-edge advancements, I have a solid understanding of various IT concepts, including systems administration, network administration, and virtualization.
