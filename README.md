###
I have a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Information Systems back in Brazil. I moved to Calgary to study the two-year New Media Production and Design program at Southern Alberta Institute of Technology. My main goal is to gain knowledge and develop my skills.
Currently, I am working as a Web Services Coordinator, but I have a new career goal, and I have been studying to become a DevOps.
